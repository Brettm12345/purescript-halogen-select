# Dropdown Example

The most minimal version of the select component has no input field at all; instead, it offers just a toggle button and a list of options rendered out to the page. It will work anywhere you require a standard dropdown, and isn't expected to have all the functionality and handling of a full typeahead.


## Use

Install dependencies and build the project:

```shell
# Install and build the project
npm install && bower install && bower link purescript-halogen-typeadead && pulp build --to dist/app.js
```

Then, open `dist/index.html` in your browser.
