# `Select` Documentation

This documentation provides a testing environment and some example components using the `Select` library. It also contains tutorials, how-to guides, and technical documentation for users of the library.

### Notes

This branch only contains generated documentation. It is an orphan branch from the main respository. If documentation is updated, that content should be copied over to this branch.

The `css` folder can be used to write custom CSS based on TailwindCSS. It builds with Webpack to the /dist/ folder. Generally, you are only responsible for copying over the example.js file between branches.
