# Let's Build a Dropdown

Dropdowns are among the simplest selection components you will build, but they can be tricky to get right. For example, you'll likely want to ensure that your users can type to highlight close text matches (like when you type "Ca" to highlight "California" in a state dropdown). You'll want to be accessible to folks using screen readers or keyboard-only navigation, too. And, of course, you'll want to achieve all this without compromising on your design.

In this tutorial, we'll build a dropdown together using `Select`. It will be ugly but functional; we won't worry much about CSS.
